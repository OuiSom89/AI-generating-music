## AI generating music

I created an AI generator based on a script developed by [Andrej Karpathy](https://github.com/karpathy) on [this code](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JMLa53HDuA-i7ZBmqV7ZnA3c_fvtXnx-?usp=sharing).

## How does it work?

You have these options,

| batch_size | 16
| --- | --- |
| block_size | 32 |
| max_iters | 1000000 |
| eval_interval | 10000 |
| learning_rate | 0.001 |
| eval_iters | 200 |
| n_embd | 64 |
| n_head | 4 |
| n_layer | 4 |
| dropout | 0.0 |
